# Next.js 13 Redux and Redux Persist Example Project

This example project integrates Redux and Redux Persist using Next.js 13. Redux is used to manage the global state of your application, and Redux Persist ensures that this state is stored in local storage and persists across page transitions.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow the steps below.

### Requirements

- Node.js should be installed.
- npm or yarn package manager should be installed.

### Installation

1. Clone or download this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone [repo-link]




## Running
To start the project, run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
# or
   ```bash
   yarn dev


## Usage
This example project demonstrates incrementing and decrementing a value on a page using Redux. Additionally, thanks to Redux Persist, this value will be preserved even when the page is refreshed.
